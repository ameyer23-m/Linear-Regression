# Zillow Home Pricing Linear-Regression
This is the code for investigating Housing Prices.
The link for the dataset from Kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
The multiple linear regression model investigates if common variables found on a Zillow home description are capable of predicting home prices. The first model includes lot area, year the house was built, livable area, bedrooms above ground, fireplace, number of cars that can fit in the garage, and the number of bathrooms. Then, the second model also includes the same variables as the first, along with the heating type, central air type, garage type, roof material, exterior material, and home style.
